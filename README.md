## Planetary Simulation

This project is a very basic real-time 3D planetary simulation and visualization built in Rust using wgpu for GPU-accelerated rendering and winit for windowing and input.
It models celestial bodies interacting through gravity, rendering them as spheres with lighting and camera controls.
